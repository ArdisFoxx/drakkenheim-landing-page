Change log: 

* 1.0.2 - Public release for Foundry v11
* 1.0.3 - Changed compatibility to require v11, as Foundry changed the way compendium folders work in v11.
* 1.0.4 - Added tokens for Petra, Ansom and Blackjack Mel, and a large number of generic tokens for use with other humanoids and monsters.
* 1.0.5 - Changes Drakkenheim map to the correct one with 21 legend keys. Adds a brochure to the landing page to switch to Emberwood map. Adds shop vendors to Emberwood village map. Adds heraldry to Faction journals
* Note that the gold reward values in quests will need to be double checked for the system you are running it in. As I'm running my Drakkenheim game in PF2e, the gold rewards may reflect that.
* 1.0.6 - Added Alternate Ryan Greymere tokens and redux maps
* 2.0.0 - Initial Pathfinder 2e Isometric Release.
* 2.12.0 - V12 Foundry update. Features broad updates to the module, including maps, tokens, and journals. Removal of Monk's Enhanced Journal dependency in favour of default core Foundry journals and the Ripper93's Simple Quest module. Emberwood Merchants now configured as Item Piles. Contamination condition updated. Spells updated. New monsters added. Old monsters tweaked and improved. Additional monsters, maps and items added from my home campaign. Den of Desire faction added with a young Oscar Yoren and his incubus companion Belthazar.
* 2.12.2 - Updating scenes, actors, removal of lewd content (Den of Desire Actors require ArdisFoxx's Lewd PF2e https://www.patreon.com/ardisfoxxart/shop/ardisfoxxs-lewd-pf2e-1272244?source=storefront)
