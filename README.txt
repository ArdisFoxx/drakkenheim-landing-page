Installation Instructions

1. Install the "Monk's Active Tile Triggers", "Monk's Enhanced Journal" and "Lock View" modules in Foundry. Don't activate your world yet.

2. Unpack the "modules" and "Drakkenheim" folders into your FoundryVTT\data folder.

3. Go to Foundry and open your world. Go to Modules setup. Activate the modules you installed above, and also "Drakkenheim Landing Page".

4. Go to your compendiums and search for "Drakkenheim". You will find Scenes, Journals, Macros and Roll Tables.

Scroll down until you see the settings for Landing - Minimal Desecration and Landing - The Nobodies. Check the first and second boxes on the left. Click Close. Click Hide Control Button. Click Save Changes.

Customizing It For Your Campaign

1. Note that the PSD file is included in the Drakkenheim UI Assets folder. Open this in Clipstudio Paint, Photoshop or whatever PSD editor you have access to. There are many free apps that can edit PSD files. I recommend https://www.photopea.com/ as its a free opensource online app that doesn't require installation.
Using the Drakkenheim_Landing_Page.psd, replace the PC images with pics of your campaign's PCs. 
Export the file in JPEG format and save over Drakkenheim-Landing-Page-v2.jpg and Drakkenheim-Landing-Page-v2.1.jpg files in the "Drakkenheim UI Assets\Landing Page" folder.

2. Rename the Landing scenes to whatever you like. The existing names are references to my two campaign groups.

2. Monk's Active Tile Triggers makes tiles clickable buttons. Edit the active tile links by double-clicking a tile > Triggers > Actions. Change the Card journals to link to a different player journal instead of the ones I included from my own campaign.

3. Drag any macros that you want to use into your hotbar. These reference the included roll tables.

4. Check out the Drakkenheim Journals I included. I've added every quest in the Drakkenheim book, and these are linked to the Factions journals too. Using Monk's Enhanced Journals, players can see any quests that you've flagged as active.
Some example quests are active so you will want to deactivate those so your players can't see them. Go to the Journal Notes button on the left sidebar and click the Toggle Objectives button to show Quests. You can then double-click any of those quests on the popup window and uncheck "Show to Players" to remove player permissions over it and "Display in Notifications" to remove it from the Quests popup window.

5. Note that the Drakkenheim UI Assets folder also includes images used in my previous module "Drakkenheim Landing Menu". I've left these in there in case they might be useful for you. Check out the Backdrops, Emoji by ArdisFoxx and Tokens subfolders.

6. The Faction Reputation Sliders on the landing page are all tiles, showing PC's relationship with the factions, from Nemesis > Enemy > Neutral > Ally > Champion. Included in the Drakkenheim UI Assets folder are slider tile images for Enemy/Neutral/Ally in red/grey/blue colours respectively.
