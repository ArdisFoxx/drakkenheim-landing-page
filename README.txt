Drakkenheim Landing Page
Made by /u/ArdisFoxx based on original design by /u/Sinlupus
https://ardisfoxxart.carrd.co/

Change log: 
1.0.2 - Public release for Foundry v11
1.0.3 - Changed compatibility to require v11, as Foundry changed the way compendium folders work in v11.
1.0.4 - Added tokens for Petra, Ansom and Blackjack Mel, and a large number of generic tokens for use with other humanoids and monsters.
1.0.5 - Changes Drakkenheim map to the correct one with 21 legend keys. Adds a brochure to the landing page to switch to Emberwood map. Adds shop vendors to Emberwood village map. Adds heraldry to Faction journals
Note that the gold reward values in quests will need to be double checked for the system you are running it in. As I'm running my Drakkenheim game in PF2e, the gold rewards may reflect that.
1.0.6 - Added Alternate Ryan Greymere tokens and redux maps


The whole landing page is interactive using Monk's Active Tile Triggers. Features:

-Clicking the gold bag opens the party loot vault (Monk's Enhanced Journal)

-Clicking the candle opens the Sacred Flame lore page

-Clicking the faction icons open their journal pages

-Clicking the player cards open the player's personal journals

-Clicking the astrolabe opens lore about delerium and the haze. These feature homebrew changes to contamination that make contamination usable in both PF2e and 5e

-Clicking the maps opens them in an image view

-The faction reputation sliders are all tiles that can be moved around, showing the PCs reputation with factions from nemesis > enemy > neutral > ally > champion

-Diablo II sound effects on all the tile triggers

//Installation Instructions//

Install the Required Modules:
https://foundryvtt.com/packages/monks-active-tiles
https://foundryvtt.com/packages/monks-enhanced-journal
https://foundryvtt.com/packages/LockView/

Activate the module "Drakkenheim Landing Page" and it will prompt you to activate the ones above.

Go to your compendiums and search for "Drakkenheim". You will find Scenes, Journals, Macros and Roll Tables. Import them all. Check the box "Keep Document IDs".
-----------------

//Customize It For Your Campaign//

Note that the PSD file is included in the "modules/drakkenheim-landing-page/Drakkenheim UI Assets" folder. Open this in Clipstudio Paint, Photoshop or whatever PSD editor you have access to. There are many free apps that can edit PSD files. I recommend https://www.photopea.com/ as its a free opensource online app that doesn't require installation.
Using the Drakkenheim_Landing_Page.psd, replace the PC images with pics of your campaign's PCs. 
Export the file in JPEG format and save over Drakkenheim-Landing-Page-v2.jpg and Drakkenheim-Landing-Page-v2.1.jpg files in the "Drakkenheim UI Assets\Landing Page" folder.

Rename the Landing scenes to whatever you like. The existing names are references to my two campaign groups.

Monk's Active Tile Triggers makes tiles clickable buttons. 
Edit the active tile links by double-clicking a tile > Triggers > Actions. 
Change the Card journals to link to a different player journal instead of the ones I included from my own campaign.

Drag any macros that you want to use into your hotbar. These reference the included roll tables.

Check out the Drakkenheim Journals I included. I've added every quest in the Drakkenheim book, and these are linked to the Factions journals too. Using Monk's Enhanced Journals, players can see any quests that you've flagged as active.
Some example quests are active so you will want to deactivate those so your players can't see them. Go to the Journal Notes button on the left sidebar and click the Toggle Objectives button to show Quests. You can then double-click any of those quests on the popup window and uncheck "Show to Players" to remove player permissions over it and "Display in Notifications" to remove it from the Quests popup window.

Note that the "modules/drakkenheim-landing-page/Drakkenheim UI Assets" folder also includes images used in my previous module "Drakkenheim Landing Menu". I've left these in there in case they might be useful for you. Check out the Backdrops, Emoji by ArdisFoxx and Tokens subfolders.

The Faction Reputation Sliders on the landing page are all tiles, showing PC's relationship with the factions, from Nemesis > Enemy > Neutral > Ally > Champion. Included in the Drakkenheim UI Assets folder are slider tile images for Enemy/Neutral/Ally in red/grey/blue colours respectively.
